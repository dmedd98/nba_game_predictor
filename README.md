This project has the goal of being able to predict results of a NBA game. The model will use an assortment of advanced statistics from recent games, the season up to that point, how a team does at home vs on the road and more to make predictions. Since there is so much randomness that can occur to affect the result of a basketball game, it is fairly difficult to predict the winner with a high accuracy. We hope to end up with a model that predicts the winner correctly approximately 70% of the time and predict the spread and over/under correctly at least 55% of the time.

Potential stakeholders for a project like this could be a sports gambling company that is looking to set the most accurate spread lines or anyone that has an interest in predicting the winner of NBA games at a high rate.

Accuracy will be the main focus for now, all games are equal in the scenerio and the goal is to correctly pick as many as possible.
